* 2) How to compile
*********************************************************************************************

** Requires Visual Studio 2012 to build

EasyHook 2.7 includes a MSBuild script to build all versions of the binaries as well as
packaging for deployment, just run build.bat and then build-package.bat.
(requires the MSBuild Community Tasks https://github.com/loresoft/msbuildtasks)

After running the build-package.bat you will have all files you need for deployment with an
application located in the ".\Deploy\NetFX3.5" and ".\Deploy\NetFX4.0" directories. This is 
what you get with the "Binaries Only" package.

Please note that there are now different configurations for .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.0:

"netfx3.5-Debug\x64"
"netfx3.5-Debug\x86"
"netfx3.5-Release\x64"
"netfx3.5-Release\x86"
"netfx4-Debug\x64"
"netfx4-Debug\x86"
"netfx4-Release\x64"
"netfx4-Release\x86"

When compiling for distribution without using the build script you must build once for "x64" 
and then once for "x86" for the applicable framework version.

The project files include MSBuild tasks to copy and rename files as appropriate. The 
TargetFrameworkVersion is also overridden in each configuration - this is not visible 
within the VS2010 project settings GUI. To change the framework version or AfterBuild tasks
you must edit the project files directly:
 * in VS2010, right click project file: "Unload"
 * right click project file: "Edit ..csproj"

For testing purposes, as long as you keep all test applications in either the "x86" or "x64" 
directory, they will run properly. The "Deploy" directory is meant to contain all files 
necessary to ship an application based on EasyHook.

* 3) Prerequisites
*********************************************************************************************

Since the CRT is now statically compiled, you won't need the Visual Studio Redistributable 
package anymore. For testing purposes I would always recommend to use the DEBUG version...

.NET 3.5 or .NET 4.0 is required for Managed hooks.
